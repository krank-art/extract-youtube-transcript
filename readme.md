# Extract transcript from YouTube videos

* Created by Krank, inspired by PinoPatch use of https://youtubetranscript.com/.
* Adapted tutorial from Marc Maxmeister, 2022-09-01, https://stackoverflow.com/a/73572089/how-to-add-punctuation-to-text-using-python.
* Model used to add punctuation: https://huggingface.co/oliverguhr/fullstop-punctuation-multilang-large.
* Supported languages: English, German, French, Italian
* Motivation: 
  1. Show rampant rambling in some YouTube videos.
  2. Get neatly formatted transcript from autogenerated subtitles.


## Usage

1. Create a virtual environment with `python -m venv env`
2. Activate the virtual environment with `venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows) or `source venv/bin/activate` (MacOS + Linux).
   * It can happen that the Powershell execution policy on Windows does not allow you to create a virtual environment.
   * To fix this you have to bypass the script execution policy in Powershell.
   * You can also set up VS Code  so it automatically allows you to activate the Python environment.
   * Open settings.json and add the following code: 
     ```json
       "terminal.integrated.profiles.windows": {
         "PowerShell": {
           "source": "PowerShell",
           "icon": "terminal-powershell",
           "args": ["-ExecutionPolicy", "Bypass"]
         }
       },
       "terminal.integrated.defaultProfile.windows": "PowerShell",
     ```
3. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`. This might take a while because the punctuation model alone is 2.4 GB.
4. Run `python main.py stxVBJem3R > output.txt`
   * `stxVBJem3R` is just an example of a YouTube video id.
   * `> output.txt` is optional, it allows you to pipe the output directly into a text file.
   * When running the script the first time, additional modelers get downloaded. This might take a few moments.


## Example


```bash
$ python main.py "6wkVGQ8swBg"

Thank you everyone for coming today.
This is why care about wholesome games anyway.
Uh, before we get started, I was asked to ask everyone to silence your phones.
Uh, I'm very clumsy so if something goes off, I'll probably be startled and fall off the stage, so please keep that in mind.
Uh, today we're talking about wholesome games.
It's a genre of games that's grown a lot in the past few years, but maybe isn't the most clearly defined or best understood yet.
Um, so we're going to be trying to uh shine some light on both of those things today.
My name is James telman.
I've been working in games for about eight years.
